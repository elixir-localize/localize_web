# TODO

Work planned for `localize_web`. Design documents, when a task needs one, live under `plans/`; shipped changes are described in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## Done

* [x] **Live navigation keeps the locale of the route** — `Localize.Routes.localize_live_session/3` puts each locale's live routes in their own live session, and a localized `live` route outside it warns at compile time. 2026-09-27, v1.2.0.

* [x] **URL locale wins by default** — `Localize.Plug.PutLocale` now checks `[:route, :path, :query, :session, :accept_language]` by default. 2026-09-27, v1.2.0.
